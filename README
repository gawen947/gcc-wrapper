A wrapper to GCC to override compilation options
================================================

The wrapper uses a compilation profile which can be setted with the GCC_PROFIL
environnement variable. This environnement variable will select a profile file
located in /etc/gcc-wrapper (global profiles) or ~/.config/gcc-wrapper (user
profiles). The current profil cbn be found with gcc --wrapper.

The installation script will divert gcc on debian and install the default
profile.  This default profile gives an insight about the available control
options. The script also works on other distribution but you should install the
script by yourself. You should divert gcc with this script and place the real
gcc executable somewhere else.
